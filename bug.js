This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera settings.  If you set certain camera properties, such as `flashMode` or `autoFocus`, and then attempt to quickly switch between those settings or even attempt to access the camera again, the camera may freeze or stop functioning correctly.  Specifically, the preview may remain blank or the camera may become unresponsive to further changes in properties. This can happen on both Android and iOS, making it a cross-platform issue.  The problem seems exacerbated when rapidly changing settings within a short time period, suggesting a potential race condition or asynchronous issue within the Expo Camera API.
