The issue can be mitigated by using a debounce function to control the rate at which camera settings are changed. This prevents rapid, consecutive calls to update the camera parameters, thereby reducing the likelihood of the API becoming unresponsive.  Here's how you can implement a debounce function:

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeout;
  return function executedFunction(...args) {
    const later = () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      func(...args);
    };
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
  };
}

// Example usage with Expo Camera:

const [flashMode, setFlashMode] = useState(Camera.Constants.FlashMode.off);

const handleFlashModeChange = debounce(() => {
  setFlashMode(flashMode === Camera.Constants.FlashMode.off ? Camera.Constants.FlashMode.on : Camera.Constants.FlashMode.off);
}, 500); // Debounce with 500ms delay

<Button title="Toggle Flash" onPress={handleFlashModeChange} />
```

By applying the `debounce` function to the function that changes the camera settings, we ensure that setting changes are batched to prevent overwhelming the Camera API.
